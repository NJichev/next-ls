## Contributing

This project follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and will "Squash and Merge" pull requests. 

This means that you don't necessarily need to write your actual commit messages with Conventional Commits, but the Pull Request title needs to, as it is used as the commit title when squashing and merging. There is a CI check to enforce this.

Conventional Commits are required to use [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please), which is used to automate the changelog, release, and building/publishing executables.
